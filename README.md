Subscriptionss Calendar is a lightweight web app for tracking and visualizing recurring subscriptions on a monthly calendar. It highlights upcoming renewal dates and aims to provide quick add/edit/delete flows. I made it for my own use with help of Windsurf. It is pretty plain and simple, but it does the job.
